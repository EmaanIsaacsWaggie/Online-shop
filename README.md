# Online_shop

## Description
"This online shopping page is a fun and easy-to-use store where you can browse 10 different products. It’s built with Bootstrap, so it looks great on any device.
Each product features a cool image that changes when you hover over it, making it more interactive. You’ll find the product name and price below the image, along with a "Buy" button to encourage purchases (though it doesn’t work just yet!).
At the bottom, there’s a simple contact form where visitors can leave their details, along with a small company logo to show off the brand.
Overall, this page is a blend of style and usability, perfect for a great online shopping experience!
